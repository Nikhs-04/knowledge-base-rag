Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It includes various subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types:

1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data with known outcomes
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error with rewards

Popular machine learning algorithms include:
- Neural Networks - Inspired by biological brains
- Decision Trees - Tree-like models for classification
- Random Forests - Collections of decision trees
- Support Vector Machines - For classification and regression

Applications of AI and ML include:
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection

Python is the most popular programming language for AI and ML, with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
